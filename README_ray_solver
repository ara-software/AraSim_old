From the conversation between Amy Connolly and Christopher Weaver,

     to compile,

     make -f ray_solver_makefile


     to run,

     ./ray_solver 0 0 100 100 0 100

     which means rays between the points (0,0,100) and (100,0,100).
     I believe first point is for source and second is for target.
