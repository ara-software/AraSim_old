8/25/10	Connolly   Committed first version to be released to RadioSim group, tagged Release_Connolly_082510.  This version compiles and runs without errors but does not actually calculate anything.

9/8/11 E. Hong  Modified few files to work compiling on ubuntu. Below are modified things

EarthModel.cc : as there are no "Signal.h" file, copied signal.hh and signal.cc files from icemc and added.
EarthModel.cc : changed #include "earthmodel.hh" to "EarthModel.h"
EarthModel.cc : changed #include "icemodel.hh" to "IceModel.h"
EarthModel.cc : changed #include "vector.hh" to "Vector.h"
EarthModel.cc : changed #include "position.hh" to "Position.h"
EarthModel.cc : added #include <cstdlib>

Tools.cc : changed #include <fstream.h> to <fstream>

signal.cc : changed #include "vector.hh" to "Vector.h"
signal.cc : changed #include "position.hh" to "Position.h"

Added Settings.h and Settings.cc for set variables and initialize them.

AraSim.cc : added #include "Settings.h"
AraSim.cc : modified variable settings. Now Settings class will define and read variables from file.
AraSim.cc : print variable values to check initialize works fine and read file works fine.

Added setup.txt file to set variable vales. For more detail, read setup.txt file.

Makefile : added Settings.cc to CCFILE
Makefile : changed CCFILE -> Signal.cc to signal.cc


9/16/11 E. Hong; Modified Detector.cc, Detector.h, AraSim.cc.

Detector class : removed original parts
                 defined 3 different modes for Detector class.
                 mode 0 : use testbed antenna infomation
                 mode 1 : small number of stations (1 ~ 7). Array increase as pentagon shape
                 mode 2 : pentagon shape station arrays.

Above, in mode 1 and 2, each station will contain 4 strings and 4 surface antennas. The map of single station is shown in "ARADetailMap.pdf" file.
We can change the distance between center of station and strings (R_string),
Distance between center of station and surface antennas (R_surf),
Maximum depth of string (z_max), distance between antennas on the string (z_btw), etc.

Also, we can change the center of pentagon array (core_x, core_y),
distance between stations (station_spacing)

In mode 1 : total number of stations (number_of_stations)
            
In mode 2 : number of stations on the side (stations_per_side)

More detail will be shown on AraSim_doc.pdf file.


9/19/11 E. Hong; Modified AraSim.cc, added testbed_info.txt file.

AraSim.cc : added one more plot in pdf file output. Added plot is for borehole antenna layout.
testbed_info.txt : file added. This file should have added in previous version.
AraSim_doc.pdf : fixed some typos.
